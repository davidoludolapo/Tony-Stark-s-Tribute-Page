             <p>Tony Stark was a billionaire genius but a mortal man.
                He applied his skills designing weapons for the government.</p>   
             <p>He went to the Middle East to demonstrate his goods
                but was captured by some terrorist goons.</p>   
             <p>The terrorists made Tony Stark a slave
                building missiles out of parts they had saved.</p>   
             <p>Instead Tony made a metal suit
                with a flamethrower and rockets in his boots.</p>   
             <p>He took on the terrorists in a fight
                and escaped his captors in broad daylight.</p>   
             <p>Crashing in the desert he then was found
                with peices of his armor scattered on the ground.</p>   
             <p>Tony brought the suit back home
                to build a new kind of superhero.</p>   
             <p>He designed a suit with a power plant built into Tony's chest
                and a voice activated program named J.A.R.V.I.S with an English accent.</p>   
             <p>But his Vice-President tried to steal the plans
                and built a bigger suit to put Tony to an end.</p>   
             <p>
                Tony won that fight and proclaimed, "I AM THE IRONMAN".
                That's how this superhero's story began.</p>
